Defacing
--------
All anatomical images were defaced by the submitter using mri_deface (freesurfer),
with the exception of sub-CTL12_T1w_pydeface.nii.gz, sub-ODN01_T1w_pydeface.nii.gz,
sub-ODP10_T1w_pydeface.nii.gz and sub-ODP12_T1w_pydeface.nii.gz. We defaced these 
four images using pydeface. The code can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface
